	<h2>First Update</h2>
	<h3>2021-05-05</h3>
<p>This is the day we were able to setup the VPS</p>
<br>
<p>* I added 3 users for the 3 Team Members (Geon, Jordano and Christopher)
<p>* I gave each user their proper passwords</p>
<p>* I gave each of the users a group</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	<h2>The Second Update</h2>
	<h3>2021-05-07</h3>
<p>I worked on this Website :3</p>
<br>
<p>* First i made my main.css file that will be used by all my html files (had a bit of trouble with the nav bar)</p>
<p>* Then i worked on the Introduction.html file (implemented a button that i can click to proceed to the Journal.html)</p>
<p>* I worked on the Journal.html file and finished with no issues (updated news each day)</p>
<p>* Finally added the website tab (Website.html)</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>The Third Update</h2>
<h3>2021-05-09</h3>
<p>working on the website with the others</p>
<br>
<p>*we initially started on the homepage html by figuring out the css file together on how we would get a navigation section to work. Then the images we would use and what the person seeing the website would see</p>
<p>*we then worked on the about.html (added what website is used for)</p>
<p>*Then i went back to my personal website to implement the website button to be connected to the homepage.html so my website is connected to the main website</p>
